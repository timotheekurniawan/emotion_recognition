# emotion_recognition
This repository consists of all the Jupyter notebooks we ran for testing and experimenting on various models for our project. Basically, these were the models we experimented:

1. VGG architecture with undersampling of dataset
2. VGG architecture with oversampling of dataset
3. VGG architecture with class weights method
4. Resnet50 architecture with undersampling of dataset
5. Resnet50 architecture with oversampling of dataset
6. Resnet50 architecture with class weights method
7. InceptionResNet architecture with undersampling of dataset
8. InceptionResNet architecture with oversampling of dataset
9. InceptionResNet architecture with class weights method

For the final version of our model, we decided to use (9) InceptionResNet architecture with class weights method, which in the actual implementation, gives us the best results.
